* Motivation and Purpose for the Project
- A web-based system for managing and synthesizing exams
  - Intended to replaces current offline system
- General problem
  - With the increase in the size of the student body, it has become difficult to manage grading within the given time-constraints
  - This has led many courses to adopt a multiple-choice format, which is faster to grade, and easier to analyse
  - The creation of challenging multiple-choice tests in the sciences is a non-trivial task
  - The client, Mayer Goldberg, has developed a theory of meta-questions and their translation into multiple-choice questions
  - A system was created to synthesize & generate multiple-choice questions from a fixed number of categories of /meta-questions/
  - The system has now been in use for 6-7 years in a large number of courses
- Specific problem
  - The system is in serious need of redesign and reimplementation to support many additional functions
  - The new system should be
    - Web-based
    - Support various roles (for TAs, graders, instructors, etc)
    - Support flexible content creation
    - Support flexible generation of exams
    - Support many additional features
- What is the solution?
- How will you evaluate the solution?
  - Enter it into active use in 3 courses
  - There are other faculty members who have expressed interest in using said project 

* Project Description
- Describe the project
  - Workflow-Management System (WMS) for managing [mainly] multiple-choice exams
    - Roles
      - System Administrator
	- Responsibilities
	  - Manage WMS at the dept/university level
	- Activities
	  - Migrate, install, update, manage WMS system
	    - Install WMS
	    - Clone WMS
	    - Update WMS
	  - Manage courses in WMS
	    - Create new course entry in WMS
	    - Backup and remove course entry in WMS
	    - Assign initial roles per course (administrator)
	    - Remove, change roles per course (when course staff changes)
      - Course Administrator
	- Define course staff
	- Assign roles to course staff
	- Define exams
	  - Define exam type (test, quiz)
	  - Define the exam direction (RTL, LTR)
	  - Define the exam length
	  - Define the exam date
	  - Define stylistic elements (fonts & sizes)
	  - Define frontal matter for the exam, test
	    - Basic headers
	    - Instructions
	  - Define basic layout
	    - number of columns
	    - number of items (4 or 5)
	    - number of versions for the exam
	  - Select questions
	  - Select appendices
	- Generate exam documents
	  - Generate exam versions
	  - Generate special version for reading-impaired
	    - A4, but landscape, and 41% larger
	  - Generate exam keys
	    - As PDF
	    - As CSV
	  - Generate exam catalog document
	  - Generate solved exam (for having out to students post exam)
	- Inspect changes by course staff
	  - Reject
	  - Accept
	  - Modify
	  - Condition upon further validation
      - Course Staff
	- People
	  - Instructors
	  - TAs
	  - Graders
	- Roles
	  - Junior: Only validate
	  - Associate: Validate & edit
	  - Senior: Full
	- Activities
	  - Add, delete, edit, validate questions
	    - Add, delete, edit, validate stem
	    - Add, delete, edit, validate keys
	    - Add, delete, edit, validate distractors
	    - Add, delete, edit, validate solutions
	    - Add, delete, edit keywords
  - WMS activities
    - Log into system
      - id, password
      - If active in more than one course, select course
    - Perform specific task
      - Can search for a specific meta-question and edit it
      - Can ask to edit the current exam, in which case, the current exam settings give focus
	- Can still write new questions, but those are now *suggested* to the course administrator, rather than added into the exam
	- Can work on existing questions, as per role
    - Ask for a task
      - WMS should offer tasks based on categories, and sorted by urgency
    - What controls urgency
      - If an exam is in preparation, then anything related to the exam is urgent, by definition
      - Incomplete questions take greater urgency
	- Questions that were marked as problematic
	- Questions for which there are not enough items
	- Questions for which there are no solutions
	- Questions the elements for which were insufficiently validated
	- Questions that lack keywords
	- etc
      - Keywords for which there are few questions
  - User interface
    -
